[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] When cornered between towering walls, don't fear the fall. Leap towards a wall, and just as your boots touch it, press jump again to spring upward. With practice, you can scale any vertical gap.
[NAME=Sign][SPEAKERSPRITE=Sign] When the path ahead seems too far, remember the wind. Press X to dash forward with speed. Use this to close great distances or even leap through danger.
